## Mohit Shukla's Github

I learned about [Shiny app](https://rstudio.github.io/) this year (2020), and how we can create and deploy pages on the web. I decided to create a bunch of pages as I continued to learn and explore the amazing things I could do. The projects mentioned on this site list a few things I could replicate.
My aim is now to host possibly as many projects as I can on this page, or whatever the limit is by shinyapps.io server.

### 1. 2020 Projects

#### a) COVID19 numbers
Using COVID19 library, I created a Shiny page to track COVID 19 global and country specific numbers. The page is available [here](https://shuklam.shinyapps.io/COVID19/)

#### b) SP500 Stocks
A summary of stocks' performance during the first half of 2020.

#### c) SP500 Stocks - update
As SP500 retook the year end level, a relook at how the individual stocks behaved

#### d) Performance comparison between SP500 & Nifty500, i.e. India vs USA
A comparison on daily returns of SP500 & Nifty500 (Total Return in USD).

### 2. UCLA MFE Projects
A list of all projects / assignments done during the UCLA MFE Program. A detailed list will be published soon.
