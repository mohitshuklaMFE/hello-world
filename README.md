# Mohit Shukla's Github

I learned about [Shiny app](https://rstudio.github.io/) this year (2020), and how we can create and deploy pages on the web. I decided to create a bunch of pages as I continued to learn and explore the amazing things I could do. The projects mentioned on this site list a few things I could replicate.
My aim is now to host possibly as many projects as I can on this page, or whatever the limit is by shinyapps.io server.

## 1. Projects

This is a repository of all projects done by me, starting in 2020. 

### a) COVID19 numbers
Using COVID19 library, I created a Shiny page to track COVID 19 global and country specific numbers. The page is available [here](https://shuklam.shinyapps.io/COVID19/)

### b) SP500 Stocks - 2020 Mar
A summary of stocks' performance during the first half of 2020.

### c) SP500 Stocks - 2020 Jun update 
As SP500 retook the year end level, a relook at how the individual stocks behaved

### d) SP500 Stocks - 2020 Dec update 
A relook at the year and the stocks that made the news.

### e) Performance comparison between SP500 & Nifty500, i.e. India vs USA
A comparison on daily returns of SP500 & Nifty500 (Total Return in USD).

### f) Comparison between Index levels and drawdowns of US & India indices
Using ggplot2, I created a subplot of graphs comparing the drawdown levels of S&P500, Dow Jones and Sensex
